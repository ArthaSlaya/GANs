# FashionGAN Project

A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of fashion items based on the **Fashion MNIST** dataset. This project demonstrates how to train a GAN model to produce synthetic images of clothing, including shirts, shoes, and dresses.

## Project Overview

This project uses a GAN architecture consisting of a generator and a discriminator:
- **Generator**: Produces synthetic fashion images.
- **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real images from the Fashion MNIST dataset and synthetic images produced by the generator.

The goal is for the generator to improve over time, ultimately creating images that look realistic enough to "fool" the discriminator.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FashionGAN-Project.git
cd FashionGAN-Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
1. **Train the Model**:
   Run the following command to start training the GAN:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
